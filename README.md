# Algorithm Visualizer & Code Execution Debugger (Mobile)

## Vision  
A mobile-first interactive learning tool that bridges the gap between theory and practice by letting you **write code and watch it execute step-by-step in memory**. Understand not just *what* algorithms do, but *how* they work under the hood—from call stack growth and recursion to real-time variable tracking and memory flow.

## The Problem  
Many developers and learners memorize algorithms without grasping the underlying execution process, leading to confusion around:

*   **Recursion** and call stack behavior
*   **Stack frames** and memory allocation
*   **Variable mutation** over time
*   **Execution order** and flow control

This app turns abstract concepts into visual, interactive insights.

## Core Features (Planned)

*   **Interactive Code Editor** with step-through debugging
*   **Live Call Stack & Stack Frame Visualization**
*   **Variable & Memory Tracking** across execution
*   **Array & Recursion Tree Animations**
*   **Time & Space Complexity Indicators**
*   **Preloaded Algorithms** with guided walkthroughs

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React Native + Expo
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Execution Engine:** Custom AST-based interpreter
*   **State Management:** Zustand or Context API
*   **Animation:** React Native Reanimated / Skia

## Roadmap

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **1** | Execution engine & core debugging foundations |
| **2** | Visual execution views (stack, arrays, recursion trees) |
| **3** | Algorithm support (Merge Sort, Binary Search, DFS) |
| **4** | Performance metrics, UI polish, and documentation |

## Target Audience

*   Computer science students
*   Coding bootcamp participants
*   Developers preparing for technical interviews
*   Educators explaining algorithm behavior

## Getting Started (Planned)

1.  Write or paste your code into the editor
2.  Step through execution line by line
3.  Observe live visualizations of stack, variables, and memory
4.  Compare complexity metrics across different inputs
